# Project 4 Trivia Game
I created a trivia game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. All the questions are being pulled from the Open Trivia Database API. A single player can select the number of questions they would like to answer, and then select from easy, medium, or hard, as well as the option for random levels of difficulty. The background image changes depending on what level of difficulty the player selects. Upon completion of one game, the player may start another game immediately with all new questions. The game tracks the player's score at the top of the page -- ten points for every correct answer -- and their score carries over into the next game unless the page is refreshed.
