# Ex-Trivia-Ganza!
I created a trivia game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All the questions are being pulled from the Open Trivia Database API. A single player can select the number of questions they would like to answer, and then select from easy, medium, or hard, as well as the option for random levels of difficulty. The background image as well as the text colors in some fields change depending on what level of difficulty the player selects. I used CSS animations to slide a modal displaying whether or not the user selected the correct answer to the question on and off screen. Within my JavaScript I relied heavily on the DOM to set up the game functionality, but hope to transfer over to Object Oriented Programming in the future to clean up the code and reduce the amount of JS it takes to run this game. Upon completion of one game, the player may start another game immediately with all new questions. The game tracks the player's score at the top of the page -- ten points for every correct answer -- and their score carries over into the next game unless the page is refreshed. HTML and CSS both passed respective validators.
